BBly Notes 23May2022

A meatball export of David Kolb's «caged_texts» from Storyspace 2.5.1 to raw HTML. I'm working up a protocol for doing this more easily in the future — watch this space!

{This form} seems to be the title page of the piece. The Storyspace and Tinderbox versions also open a Map View (see lovely screenshots enclosed), which of course we won't have yet in HTML. Without the Map, the only way to get to the texts themselves is via {Paths}, and there's only one link to that page, the second text link on <Thisform.html>. (I originally ran up a simple <index.html> to serve as the front door, then realized that blocked easy access to the server index, which I expect you'll need. DOH!)

I added a default link at the bottom of each page that has one, and indicated where there isn't one. In almost every case where there is no default link, there is at least one text link in the body of the lexia.

I didn't find any guard fields as we usually understand the term — if you look in the Links dialog in Storyspace, you'll see 'Textlink' under the 'guard field' heading — ie you have to click the string of text to follow the link: no 'riding a wave of returns'. (This reminds me of how weird links really are — but that's a Lonnnnng Discussion!)

I did find some loops: all four paths (see <Paths.html>) end up in a loop on Whiteman —> Derrida —> Schürmann —> Whiteman, etc.

About my punctuation: 
	«euroquotes» enclose an idea or entity, irrespective of its instantiation — ie «caged_texts» is David Kolb's literary and philosophical work, which doesn't really care whether it's in Storyspace, Tinderbox, or HTML!
	<angle brackets> (outside of HTML code) enclose the filename of a computer document — eg <Thisform.html> or <BBlyNotes.txt> — and ALWAYS include the application extention — except in this example!
	[square brackets] enclose an editorial comment, eg '[no default link]'
	{curly braces} enclose the name of a lexia in a hypertext, eg {This form} & {Surprise} in the Storyspace version of «caged_texts». 
	
This has been fun! Email is best if a question comes up: bbly@infomonger.com.
