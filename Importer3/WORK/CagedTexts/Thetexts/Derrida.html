<p>"Feminism's lack of style is denounced by Nietzsche: 'Is it not the worst of taste when woman sets about becoming scientific in that fashion? Enlightenment in this field has hitherto been the affair and the endowment of men--we remained 'amongst ourselves' in this.'"</p>

<p>(Jacques Derrida, <i>Spurs/Eperons</i>. Translated by Barbara Harlow.  Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1978.  P. 65)</p>
