<p>"Rickman and Pugin make and equally telling comparison.  Rickman had gone some way towards systematizing Gothic typology.  But he progressed very little in the direction of structural authenticity or liturgical planning.  His church at Carlisle (1828-30) suggests that he was hardly an archaeologist, and certainly not a liturgiologist.  He was, after all, a Quaker.  Pugin's chapel at Cotton College, Staffordshire (1840-8) would have been outside his aesthetic and theological parameters.  Catholic ecclesiology has replaced the Protestant Picturesque.  Rickman's church plans are basically Protestant auditoriums in medieval dress.  Pugin's designs--St Giles, Cheadle, for instance--aim at re-creating the sacramental system in three-dimensional form.  No wonder the Catholics of Birmingham rejected a Rickmanic chapel and settled for a Puginian cathedral (1839-56)."</p>
