<p>"To make an object which is politically situated requires two transformations.  On the one hand, the experiencing subject must be moved, moved without force or deceit from the status of user to that of performer.  On the other hand, the building itself must be made such that the power hidden in the banal is released.  This disruption of the ordinary will trigger the transformation of the subject from user to performer.  S/he must encounter the difficulties created by a disturbance of the ordinary."</p>
