<p>"We review with our patients the guidelines from the national scientific and professional societies that concern themselves with the American diet.  For example, the National Academy of Medicine recommends that people reduce their consumption of pickled foods, smoked foods, and prepared meats or avoid them altogether because of their likely relationship to certain cancers.  In practical terms this means giving up or drastically reducing consumption of salami, bologna, corned beef, sausage, ham, bacon, and hot dogs.  The American Heart Association recommends reducing red-meat consumption, drinking low-fat or skim milk, and eliminating whole milk and cream, cutting down on fatty cheeses, and restricting the intake of eggs, which contain about 300 milligrams of cholestrol per egg!  (The Ornish diet contains about 2 milligrams of cholesterol per day)."</p>
