<p>"Only two aspects of the general conviction that Reason has ruled in the world and in world history may be called to your attention.  They will give us an immediate opportunity to examine our most difficult question and to point ahead to the main theme."</p>

<p>(G.W.F.Hegel, <i>Reason in History</i>, translated by Robert S. Hartman  (Indianapolis: Bobbs Merrill, 1953), p. 13)</p>
