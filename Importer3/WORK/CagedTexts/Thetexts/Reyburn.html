<p>"The third moment in the conception of property is its surrender.  A thing becomes my property when I put my will into it: it ceases to be mine when I take my will out of it.  This relinquishment may be either an explicit and definite act, or an indefinite and lengthy process.  In the latter case it is indicated by a continued failure to maintain possession and use of the thing, and the loss is incurred through prescription.  The amount of time which must elapse before prescription can be recognized by law is, of course, arbitrary: but it should be sufficient to show that the will of the previous owner has really abandoned the thing.  The principle itself, however, is not arbitrary.  Property is an external existence of the will; it is, therefore, subject to time: and the will must maintain itself in time. 'Prescription is not merely forced into the system of right in order to exclude the strife and confusion which old claims would bring into the security of property.  On the contrary, it is based on the actual existence of property, on the necessity which forces the will to express itself if it is to possess. (<i>Philosophy of Right  64 </i>).  Hegel applies the principle to the national monuments of former peoples, to the rights of the family of a writer to his works, and to vacant land set aside for purposes that have no meaning in prsent times.  When the will of the original owner has lapsed from the thing, it is a <i>res nullius</i>, and may become the private property of others."</p>
