<p>"This conflict is only a particular expression of the larger conflict which I have pointed out in the thought of Plotinus between the representation of the universe as a rational order and that of the universe as the theater of destiny.  It is solved through a twofold elaboration; on the one hand, through a transformation of animistic physics in a direction favorable to his conception of human destiny; on the other hand, by an attempt to harmonize universal order and the individual destinies of souls.  I shall first consider the nature of this animistic physics."</p>
