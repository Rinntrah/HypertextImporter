<p>"For most of my life, since I learned that I was living in 'a modern building' and growing up as part of 'a modern family,' in the Bronx of thirty years ago, I have been fascinated by the meanings of modernity.  I have tried here to open up some of these dimensions of meaning, to explore and chart the adventures and horrors, the ambiguities and ironies of modern life.  In <i>All That Is Solid Melts Into Air</i>  I move and develop through a number of ways of reading: of texts--Goethe's <i>Faust</i>, the <i>Communist Manifesto</i>, Dostoevsky's <i>Notes from Underground</i>, and many more; but also I try to read spatial and social environments--small towns, big construction sites, dams and power plants, Joseph Paxton's Crystal Palace, Haussmann's Parisian boulevards, St Petersburg prospects, Robert Moses' highways through New York; and, finally, reading fictional and actual people's lives, from Goethe's time through Marx's and Baudelaire's and into our own.  I tried to show how all these people share, and all these books and environments express, certain distinctively modern concerns.  They are moved at once by a will to change--to transform both themselves and their world--and by a terror of disorientation and  disintegration, of life falling apart.  They all know the thrill and the dread of a world in which 'all that is solid melts into air'."</p>
