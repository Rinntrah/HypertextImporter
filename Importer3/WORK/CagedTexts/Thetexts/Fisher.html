<p>"The rivalry between two complete acts that cannot occupy the same time or site is even stronger in the case of the flag paintings than in the map or world paintings.  With the flag, the nonvisual act is dominant.  In our ordinary experience of looking at the flag we do not ordinarily spend any time at all on its details.   We regard it as a whole, and when we find ourselves in relation to it as<i> our</i>  flag, we fall into our patriotic relation to it.  That relation can either be chauvinistic or one of strong reaction against it out of a dislike of chauvinism.  Being in the presence of a flag of one's own country is completely at odds with looking carefully at it, although patriotism also requires keeping one's eyes fixed on the flag."</p>
