<p>"This does not mean that the choice of the architects invited to participate corresponds rigorously to a homogeneous design.  The advisory committee of the section, comprised of Nino Dardi, Rosario Giuffre, Giuseppe Mazzariol, Udo Kultermann and Robert Stern, decided to involve critics like Vincent Scully, Christian Norberg-Schulz, Charles Jencks and Kenneth Frampton in the organization of the exhibition, in order to guarantee a range of different and at times diverging interpretations of th theme proposed by the director of the section.  These interpretations can be compared to one another in the preparatory debate and clearly communicated to the visitors to the 'Presence of the Past' through special exhibitions."</p>
