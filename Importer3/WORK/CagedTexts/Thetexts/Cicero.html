<p>"You see now what heavy seas we are in, and if between these lines such as they are you read other things which I leave unwritten rejoin us at long last. The conditions here to which I am asking you to return are such that anyone might wish to run away from them but I hope you value my affection enough to want to get back to <i>that</i>, even with all the accompanying disagreebles. As to being registered in your absence, I shall see that a notice is published and displayed everywhere. But registration at the very end of the census period is real businessman's style. So let us see you as soon as may be.  Keep well.  20 January, Q. Metellus and L. Afranius being Consuls."</p>
