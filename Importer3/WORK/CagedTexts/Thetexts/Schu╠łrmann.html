<p>"If this is the case, it is clear that the 'phenomenological destruction of the history of ontology' promised in <i>Being and Time</i>, can be fully understood--and carried out--as a deconstruction only from the standpoint of Heidegger's last writings.  Only then does it become apparent how time can be '<i>der Sinn des Seins</i>': not the 'meaning' of being, but its directionality; the 'sense' as the direction in which something, e.g., motion, takes place (this acceptation of both the English 'sense' and the French <i>sens</i>--'sense' of a river, or of traffic--stems, not from Latin, but from an Indo-European verb that means to travel, to follow a path).  Not the 'signification' of being for a man and hence 'a human accomplishment' (a misunderstanding that Heidegger says threatened the deconstruction in its first phase, that of a destruction in <i>Being and Time </i>), but the directionality of the orderings by which constellations of presencing produce themselves.  Not the <i>sens</i> <i> unique</i>, the one-way street of the epochs unfolding across the ages either (a misunderstanding that threatened during the phase of 'the history of being'), but the multiple presencing in which things present emerge from absence.  These distinctions are what is most difficult in Heidegger.  The point here is that the correct understanding of his early writings is obtained only if he is read backward, from end to beginning."</p>
