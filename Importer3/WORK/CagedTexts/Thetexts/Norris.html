<p>"Whether or not this distinction holds in the sphere of artistic production is an issue that the reader may judge for herself when comparing the various works reproduced in this volume.  But I would suggest that any meaningful use of the phrase 'deconstructionist art' will involve at least some reference to the following characteristics.  First, it will be seen how such work tends to juxtapose visual and textual elements, producing not so much a post-modernist collage of randomly associated styles and techniques as a critical, interrogative exchange between them.  Second, this will have the effect of engaging the viewer/reader in an active decoding of the social constraints that are often concealed behind talk of aesthetic autonomy or form.  (Thus Bernard Tschumi on his designs for the Park de la Villette: 'the analysis of concepts in the most rigorous and internalised manner, but also their analysis from without, to question what these concepts and their history hide, as repression or dissimulation.')  And from this it follows, thirdly, that deconstruction maintains the kind of double-edged relation to modernist themes and techniques tht enables such analysis to be carried forward without losing its point through the sheer multiplicity of styles on offer."</p>
