<p>"Perhaps, at the extreme--but everything is always decided at the extreme--we will one day have to face the fact (decouvrir) that the god is essentially distinguishable by nothing save the extreme strangeness of his coming.  Euripides:</p>

    <blockquote>Numerous are the forms of the divine,
    <br>and numerous, the unexpected decision of the gods,
    <br>What was expected does not come about,
    <br>but for the unexpected, the god has found the means.</blockquote>

<p>(Jean-Luc Nancy, <i>The Inoperative Community</i>,  translated by Peter Connor, Lisa Garbus, Michael Holland, and Simona Sawhney  (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1991), P. 125)</p>
