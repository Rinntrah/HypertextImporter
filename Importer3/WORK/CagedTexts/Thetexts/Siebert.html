<p>"It is the aim of this study to explore, analyze, and critically evaluate Georg W. F. Hegel's philosophy of marriage and family.  The particular goal of this paper is to demonstrate to what extent for Hegel the family is the origin, the realization, and the protector of man's subjective freedom or his free subjectivity.  This question seems to be of utmost importance at the present stage of the world historical transition period from the old European civilization to a new post-modern culture, the beginning of which Hegel already predicted in the preface to his <i>Phenomenology of the Spirit</i>, and which continues today, and which is characgerized by a powerful trend toward the totally administered society and toward the end of the dignity and freedom of the individual."</p>
