<h2>Caged Texts</h2>

<p>(c) David Kolb, 1993</p>

<p>This hypertext consists of twenty-one texts <a href="Random.html">selected at random</a> from the books in my study.  Several <a href="Paths.html">paths</a> have been run through the texts, but the texts can also be accessed as you choose through the Storyspace view map.  The links on this page lead into the texts and the explanations; find them by pressing Option and Command together.</p>

<p><a href="Surprise.html">The aim</a> of the hypertext is to investigate <a href="Rorschach.html">the production of meaning</a> through the juxtaposition of random texts chosen from a personal library (and so not entirely unrelated).  I have provided paths that were also randomly created, but the reader can also use the Storyspace map to make connections.</p>

<p>[no default link in Storyspace; to access the texts themselves, open {<a href="Paths.html">Paths</a>}]</p>
