<p>I originally planned this hypertext as an objective, uncontrolled, John Cage piece of <a href="Random.html">random selections, in order to see how meaning would be generated in the hypertext during different readings. I had planned</a> some commentary to be added at the end. But I am now putting the texts in, and already, with the second and third selections, my mind begins to provide links and horizons and interpretations. I should have realized, of course, that taking my own bookshelves as the place for the random selections would begin to tell me <a href="Rorschach.html">about myself</a>. What was to be objective suddenly becomes <a href="Anoralculturehasno.html">oddly personal</a>. So I now add <a href="Immediatereactions.html">some notes</a> on the becoming of the series.</p>
