		to keep the outside outside
	</h3>

<p>"to keep the outside out...is the inaugural gesture of 'logic' itself, of good 'sense' insofar as it accords with the self-identity of that which is: being is what it is, the outside is outside and the inside inside." </p>

<p>(Jacques Derrida quoted  in George Landow,<i> Hypertext</i>, p. 60)</p>
