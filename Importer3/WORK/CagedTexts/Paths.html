		Paths

</header>

<p>A few paths have been threaded among the texts. They can be followed from the beginning links here.</p>

<p><a href="Thetexts/Fisher.html"><b>-discovery-</b></a></p>
<p>This path follows the order in which the texts were chosen by the random process.</p>

<p><a href="Thetexts/Brehier.html"><b>-r1-</a>&#xa0;  <a href="Thetexts/Kabat-Zinn.html">-r2 -</a>    <a href="Thetexts/Whiteman.html">-r3-</a>   <a href="Thetexts/H&ouml;derlin.html">-r4-</b></a></p>
<p>These paths were created by linking the texts as determined by random numbers. They do not all visit all the texts.</p>

<p>In addition, the Storyspace map view allows you to browse freely without following any of these paths, and investigate other effects.</p>
