		Rorschach

<p>If I am placed in a group of people for a time, I often find them filling a familiar set of roles that form a drama I tend to impose on my social world: self in certain (not necessarily consistent) roles, this or that other cast as mothering, authoritative, weak, and so on. It takes alertness to detect this pattern forming and not assume it is the natural characteristics of the people I am with, although these surely cooperate since not every role will fit every person.</p>

<p>If we are placed among a group of texts, as here, we may find that we are reading into their content and relations a familiar set of roles that form a pattern we tend to impose on our intellectual world: self having certain (not necessarily consistent) views and intellectual gestures with texts, this or that text as conservative, daring, aligned along familiar polarities and plots. It takes alertness to disrupt this pattern. Perhaps the artificiality of this experiment can serve as a kind of intellectual Rorschach test; can you watch yourself imposing familiar organizations on the texts? I can, and it frightens me.</p>

<p>This process is not the only production of meaning at work, nor is it purely a matter of projection. But this hypertext makes it more visible.</p>

<p>If this is Rorschach test that discovers our hidden scripts; what is the appropriate therapy?</p>
