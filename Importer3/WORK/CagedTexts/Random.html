<p>Random selection: I generated a long series of random digits on the computer, copied it down, and then used the first two digits to select a shelf (taking them modulo 21, the number of shelves), the next two to select a book (counting left to right and beginning again if needed to fill out the number), the next three to select a page (taking them modulo the number of pages of text in the book). Then I copied down the first complete paragraph at the top of the page.  </p>

<p>It all sounds quite objective, granted the decisions (what room, what part of the page, and so on). But there were problems of interpretation even of these rules (the first item was a picture; the page had columns, and so on). In one case I couldn't read the figure I had written in the random sequence, in another what was to be the shelf number turned out to be two zeros.</p>

<p>In all these cases adjustments had to be made; interpretations decreed.</p>
