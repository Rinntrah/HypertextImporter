<p><b>Reactions noted down as I am adding the texts</b>:</p>

<p>I am disappointed at the particular Dewey selection, but it goes well with the litany of animals in the Deleuze.</p>

<p>Then a list turns up <b>again</b>, in the Portoghesi selection. This time a power list, with invocation of star systems and the whole apparatus of critical judgment. Just the sort of thing John Cage fought against.</p>

<p>The beginning of the Cicero certainly seems applicable to this sort of writing, and so I try to read the latter parts, about returning to a difficult situation, as also about the situation of this writing or our situation today. Where are we returning from?</p>

<p>Another list! This time the translators of the Nancy piece. And so much classical reference.</p>

<p>The Kabat-Zinn: a feeling of embarassment that it should be chosen, and reluctance to put down the whole title. But a self-help book and a book on stress: what we return to. And another pair of lists.</p>

<p>Now it's Berman with an appropriate summary paragraph; it's good to have it, but another list.</p>

<p>The latest chosen texts (Anderson and Brehier) have anaphoric words in their first sentences ("this dilemma" etc.) referring to items outside the paragraphs. I debated putting in explanatory parentheses but decided against it, since I want these textual fragments to link to one another, and it could be interesting if in a reading the "this" connected to the text read before.</p>

<p>Norris: is another piece that can be taken, at least in its early sentences, self-reflexively about this writing.</p>

<p>The Crook and Reyburn bring more lists, and, in the Reyburn, the question what happens to things no longer informed by the will of the owner. Texts, for instance.</p>

<p>Hegel finally showed up, but not in impossibly dense passages. He's against lists.</p>

<p>This piece of writing is a list as well as a narrative.</p>

<p>Can we avoid making lists into narratives? If the items are big enough, say the size of the paragraphs included as "the texts" here, I wonder.</p>

<p>A later reading: time and directionality, property and time, transformation from user to performer, disruption of the banal, time and disruptive gestures, the directionality of the presencing, meaning that is not a subjective achievement, all this applied in/to the texts themselves and the act of reading.</p>
